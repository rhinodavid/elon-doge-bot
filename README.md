**Tired of losing out on the Doge pump? Run the elon doge bot!**
Every time Elon tweets about Dogecoin, buy some! This bot monitors
[@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) and places a market buy order on
Binance.us if one of his new tweet mentions $DOGE.

## Usage

To run the bot, you'll need a Twitter bearer token and a Binance.us API key
and secret.

You'll also need [Rust installed on your machine](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Copy `Config.toml.example` and rename it `Config.toml`. Put your credentials in
the file and set `usdt_order_size`.

In the terminal, navigate to the repository and execute `cargo run`.
